            hello and welcome to the official Cherrys taste good website.
            <br>
            <br>
            why did you made this crew?
            <br>
            I made this crew cuz i wanted to make my own crew for my self and my friends in gta.    
            <br>
            <br>
            Why the bright blue?
            <br>
            This bright blue is the crew color.
            <br>
            <br>
            Why'd you pick this blue?
            <br>
            I picked this blue cuz is my favorite color.
            <br>
            <br>
            What made you pick the name cherrys taste good?
            <br>
            I picked it cuz i was eating some cherrys while i was makeing the crew and couldn't figure out a name for the crew.
            <br>
            <br>
            What made you come up with the logo?
            <br>
            I was boerd in class one day in 2017 and saw that i could go on the rockstar website and chane the logo for my crew.
            <br>
            <br>
             Tell me more about the great looking logo.
            <br>
             Sure i made the basic shape of he cherry part and added the white part. The white part is for vvisual effect for like what why the light is shineing one them.Then came to the stem. I picked a nice green for the stem. Then i put 2 rectangles and 2 leafs one with the cut out and one without a cut out. I used the one without the cut out to cover the gaps beetween the 2 rectangles and it added a nice effect to the cherry shape so i keet it showing. Then i added the one with the cut out to finninsh the ccherry logo.
